# LK_Optical_Flow

Open compute_LK_optical_flow.m

Set parameters:

- smooth factor for smoothing frames: sigma

- smooth factor for smoothing RHS: sigma_1d

- Window size: (2w+1)*(2w+1) ex: window size =9\*9 if w =4



 Test_flow.m can be used to display and save the motion field overlaying for a series of frames. You can choose frames from "Backyard", "Basketball", "Grove", "Mequaon", "Schefflera" ,or your can use your own frames by putting them in a new folder in this directory.
